# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration
# Project Overview
The Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration project is a user-friendly tool that uses Python, Pandas, MySQL, mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly to extract, transform, and visualize data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The project's primary goal is to provide valuable insights and information in an interactive and visually appealing manner. It involves data extraction, transformation, database insertion, and the creation of a live geo visualization dashboard.

# Problem Statement
The Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository contains a vast amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The project aims to:
Extract data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository through scripting and clone it.
Transform the data into a suitable format, perform cleaning and pre-processing.
Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
Fetch data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select various facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

# Approach:

# Data Extraction
Clone the GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data and store it in a suitable format, such as CSV or JSON.
# Data Transformation
Use Python and Pandas to manipulate and pre-process the data, including cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data for analysis and visualization.
# Database Insertion
Utilize the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.
# Dashboard Creation
Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display data on a map, and Streamlit creates a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options.
# Data Retrieval
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use this data to dynamically update the dashboard.
# Deployment
Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.
# Results
The project's results include a live geo visualization dashboard with at least 10 different dropdown options for users to explore data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The data is stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval, and the dashboard is dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.
